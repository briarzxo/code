My research websites 
https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-examples/
^ I watched alot of youtube videos and looked at images that helped me, and my code i did i didnt save :(
I also got some practice from reading some books of my dad's as he has a "Python for dummies" book which had alot of helpful
information like how to do functions and printing etc.
